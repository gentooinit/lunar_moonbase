WenQuanYi Zen Hei is a Hei-Ti style (sans-serif type) Chinese 
outline font. It is designed for general purpose text formatting 
and on-screen display of Chinese characters and symbols from
many other languages. The embolden strokes of the font glyphs 
produces enhanced screen contrast, making it easier to read
recognize. The embedded bitmap glyphs further enhance on-screen 
performance, which can be enabled with the provided 
configuration files.

WenQuanYi Zen Hei provides a fairly complete coverage to Chinese 
Hanzi glyphs, including both simplified and traditional forms. 
The total glyph number in this font is over 35,000, including over 
21,000 Chinese Hanzi. This font has full coverage to GBK(CP936) 
charset, CJK Unified Ideographs, as well as the code-points 
needed for zh_cn, zh_sg, zh_tw, zh_hk, zh_mo, ja (Japanese) 
and ko (Korean) locales for fontconfig. Starting from version 
0.8, this font package has contained two font families, i.e. 
the proportionally-spaced Zen Hei, and a mono-spaced face 
named "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono".
